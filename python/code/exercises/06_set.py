Exercise 1:
Fill function exercise1 to count how many unique characters are in the text and print the number

Help: a string can also be considered as a list of characters which means it can be used in a for loop like any other list

Optional task 1: write the code to ignore the case of the text (hint: look at the string function: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)
Optional task 2: add some code to have the user input the text
