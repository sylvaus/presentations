There is nothing easier than to display text in the terminal in python.
We simply have to use the `print` command.
The always mentioned Hello, world look as follow:
```python
print("Hello world")
```
If you want to run this code, you can simple create a python file (for example: example.py)
and run it using the following command in a terminal `python example.py`

Now that we can write in the terminal, we may want to take some input from a user.
To do so, the `input` function can be used to get input information from the user.
For example, if we wanted the name of the user, we could write the following code
```python
print("What is your name? ")
name = input()
```
We can make this more concise since the the function input takes as input the text to be displayed to the operator
Example:
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
```

Now, with this much information, you should be ready for the exercise 01_print_input.md
