# Text Reader Project

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create an application that can take either text or a filepath 
as input and read it.

Optionally, a function/method should be added to be able handle special input that would trigger some specified actions.
For example, the "text pause: 5" would not be read but a 5 seconds would happen.

## Start Folder
You will find in the start project a setup.py and a readme.md.
The setup.py has already two dependencies in it:
 * pyttsx3: this library will be used to say the text out loud
 * pytest for test only
 
## End folder
The end folder contains two project solutions:
* The one with the _func ending using a functional approach
* The one with the _class ending using an oriented object approach
